# Flutter Quiz App

## Overview
The Flutter Quiz App is a dynamic and interactive application built to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Flutter. This project showcases essential Flutter development practices, including state management, widget composition, and navigation. It is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for developers of all levels, from beginners to seasoned professionals.

### Key Highlights:
- **State Management**: The app leverages Flutter's stateful and stateless widgets to manage the state of the quiz, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Navigation**: Implements Flutter's navigation system to seamlessly transition between screens, such as the quiz interface and the results screen.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across different screen sizes.
- **Dart Language**: Written entirely in Dart, the app takes advantage of Dart's features like null safety and asynchronous programming to build a robust and efficient application.
- **Integration with Assets**: Includes custom assets like images and animations to enhance the user interface and make the app more engaging.

Whether you're exploring Flutter for the first time or looking to refine your skills, this project serves as a practical example of building a feature-rich application from the ground up.
